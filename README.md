# FoliTracking
My javascript assignment
This application tracks all the Föli busses that are driving around in Turku.
First: Select a buss you wish to track. You can then click on the show buss and show route buttons to highlight where the buss is
at the moment, and what route the buss is following. Clicking the refresh button will refresh the buss location.
To change what buss you are tracking, follow the same steps in order that you did in the first place.

NOTE: The application may be sluggish at times, due to the fact that I had to limit the possible refresh rate, as it uses an API form 
Föli's own website.
